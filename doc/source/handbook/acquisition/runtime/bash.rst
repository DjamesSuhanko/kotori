There are various ways of transmitting telemetry data from the command line.

Depending on the desired protocol, please read how to:

- MQTT: :ref:`Transmit data using mosquitto_pub <daq-mqtt-bash>`.
- HTTP: How to do :ref:`daq-curl` or :ref:`daq-httpie`.

See also :ref:`MQTT sawtooth signal <sawtooth-mqtt>` and
:ref:`HTTP sawtooth signal <sawtooth-http>` for transmitting a dynamic,
slowly oscillating sawtooth signal for getting started with a simple
periodic measurement example.
