Grafana vs. data export

Question
********
    Why is the export necessary if I can see data in Grafana already?

Answer
******
The export feature is a generic functionality and has nothing to do with the
Grafana interconnect feature for instantly graphing measurement data.
It can be used as a restful API for exporting per-channel data using all sorts
of convenient filtering, projection and different kinds of output rendering options.
