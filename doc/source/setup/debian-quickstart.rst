Introduction
************
This part of the documentation covers the installation of Kotori and other
software components it relies on.
The first step to using any software package is getting it properly installed.
Please read this section carefully.
After successfully installing the software, you might want to
follow up with its configuration at :ref:`getting-started`.


Details
=======
This document describes the installation of the whole software stack for
telemetry data acquisition, processing and visualization on a Debian-based
system. It is currently made of these free and open source software components:

- :ref:`Kotori`, a data acquisition, graphing and telemetry toolkit
- Grafana_, a graph and dashboard builder for visualizing time series metrics
- InfluxDB_, a time-series database
- Mosquitto_, a MQTT message broker
- MongoDB_, a document store (optional) ¹²

The package repository supports both architectures ``amd64`` and ``armhf`` (arm32v7).

| ¹ MongoDB is only required when doing CSV data acquisition, so it is completely
| optional for regular operations of Kotori.
| ² As MongoDB - strictly speaking - stopped being free software recently (2018/2019),
| it will probably be phased out gradually and replaced by PostgreSQL.


Outlook
=======
Some effort has been done to make the installation process of Kotori and
associated software components as easy and straight forward as possible.

However, things are complicated sometimes so there might still be rough
edges we would love to learn about. So, don't hesitate to drop us a note
by `opening an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/daq-tools/kotori/issues/new>`_
or reaching out to ``support@getkotori.org``. Thanks already.


************
Installation
************

Prerequisites
=============
We are going to do telemetry data acquisition, sometimes coming from measurement
systems which **do not** send appropriate timestamps. Thus, the timekeeping
of your data acquisition system itself should be accurate.

So, either enable the NTP feature of ``systemd``::

    timedatectl set-ntp true

or install ``chrony``::

    apt install chrony

or implement any other valid equivalent to keep the system time sound.

For registering 3rd-party package repositories offering their packages
through https, please invoke the following commands::

    apt install apt-transport-https software-properties-common wget gnupg


Register the mosquitto package repository
=========================================
Add GPG key for checking package signatures::

    wget -qO - https://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-repo.gpg.key | apt-key add -

Add package source for either Debian 10.x buster or Ubuntu 18 Bionic Beaver::

    apt-add-repository 'deb https://repo.mosquitto.org/debian buster main'

or Debian 9.x stretch::

    apt-add-repository 'deb https://repo.mosquitto.org/debian stretch main'


Register the main package repository
====================================
Add GPG key for checking package signatures::

    wget -qO - https://packages.elmyra.de/elmyra/foss/debian/pubkey.txt | apt-key add -

Add package source for either Debian 10.x buster::

    apt-add-repository 'deb https://packages.elmyra.de/elmyra/foss/debian/ buster main foundation'

or Ubuntu 18 Bionic Beaver::

    apt-add-repository 'deb https://packages.elmyra.de/elmyra/foss/debian/ bionic main foundation'

or Debian 9.x stretch::

    apt-add-repository 'deb https://packages.elmyra.de/elmyra/foss/debian/ stretch main foundation'

Reindex package database::

    apt update


Setup the whole software stack
==============================
Install Kotori together with all recommended and suggested packages::

    apt install --install-recommends kotori

InfluxDB and Grafana are not always enabled and started automatically,
so ensure they are running by invoking::

    systemctl enable influxdb grafana-server
    systemctl start influxdb grafana-server

Notes for ARM machines
======================
For using Kotori on ARM machines like the RaspberryPi or the BeagleBone,
we prepared a lightweight package with fewer dependencies
called ``kotori-standard``. To install it, invoke::

    apt install --install-recommends kotori-standard


*********
Operation
*********

Watching the system
===================
These are the log files at a glance where system messages might appear::

    tail -F /var/log/kotori/*.log /var/log/grafana/*.log /var/log/influxdb/*.log /var/log/mosquitto/*.log
    journalctl -f -u influxdb


*************
Configuration
*************
Follow along at :ref:`getting-started` to configure and use your first Kotori application.

Have fun and enjoy your data acquisition!
